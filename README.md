# appsec-acronyms

An alphabetical listing of (mostly) appSec-related acronyms, initialisms, and abbreviations.  Intended to help make sense out of the alphabet soup of AppSec & InfoSec abbreviations, and geek speak in general.  Each has a Google link to the term to help get started with additional detail and meaning. In some cases, a brief explanation is provided.  

I've also included an [AWS](#aws) section which may be helpful to those just getting started out using AWS
